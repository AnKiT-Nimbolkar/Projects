Project:RFID-Based Smart Shopping Cart with Automatic Billing System.
Our initiative is focused on creating a smart shopping cart with an automatic billing system. 
We developed a practical and effective shopping solution using RFID technology and an Arduino Uno board. 
Each product in the system has RFID tags that are scanned by an EM18 RFID reader, an Arduino Uno board, and an LCD screen.
The Arduino Uno analyses the data and adds the item to the basket as soon as a user scans an RFID-tagged product with the reader, updating the final bill in the process. 
The LCD panel shows real-time data such as the running total and product specifics.
This streamlines the billing process and does away with the need for human computations.
Overall, by automating the charging procedure right in the shopping cart, our idea intends to improve the shopping experience.
Users can easily scan things, keep track of their purchases, and have the bill computed automatically with our Smart Shopping Kart.
This method streamlines procedures for both customers and retailers, cuts down on human error, and saves time.
